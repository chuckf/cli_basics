== Different Shells

When we speak of the command line, we are working in what is known as a shell.
A shell is a program that passes typed commands to the computer's operating system to execute.
The following is a list of popular shells that you will encounter:

* bash
* dash
* sh
* ksh
* zsh
* csh
* powershell

Current shell - `echo $0`

Default shell - `echo $SHELL`

== Different *nixes
// I don't think this is really needed here

There are many different *nix versions and cousins.
The flavors include *BSD, Linux, Unix, and others.
Each version and implementation has some unique features to their shells.
Some popular versions and distributions are:

* Red Hat/CentOS
* Fedora
* Ubuntu
* SUSE
* Debian
* Solaris
* FreeBSD
* MacOS/OS X
* AIX
* OpenBSD

== File structure

* File locations differ between distributions
* Common directories
** `/` (Root of the file system)
** `/root` (root user's home directory)
*** This is not the root(`/`) of the file system
** `/home/$USER` (Your files)
** `/etc` (System configuration files)
** `/media` (Mount points for removable systems, primarily linux flavors)
** `/opt` (Typically commercial software packages installed in one place)
// Need to reword the opt dir description
** `/var` (Variable files that change regularly)
** `/var/log` (Common default location for log files)

== Command Line Interface (CLI) Package Installers

`yum install <package>`

`apt-get install <package>`

* `yum`/`dnf`
** Red Hat
** CentOS
** Fedora
** SUSE
* `apt-get`
** Debian
** Ubuntu

(yum is in the process of being replaced by dnf)

== Basic Navigation

* CasE SensItiVity MatTERs
* tab completion to complete command names, paths, or files
* `pwd` (Print working[current] directory)
* `ls` (list files in directory)
* `cd` (Change Directory)
** `cd` or `cd ~` changes from the current directory to the user's home directory
** `cd /path/to/directory` changes from the current directory to the defined directory
** `cd ..` changes from the current directory to the directory one level up
** `cd ../../path/to/directory` changes from the current directory to two levels up then down to the new directory
** `cd -` changes from the current directory to the previous directory

This is not navigation, but you need to know this

* `^n` or `^-n` reads as ctrl-n
* $ appended to the beginning of a word is a variable that can represent an option in that context

== Command Line Switches

Commands are often followed by one or more switches at the command line.
When one `-` is used, each character following it is an option.
When two '--' are used, the full string is considered the option.

`ls -help` attempts to run the `ls` command with the h,l,p options*

`ls --help` prints the `ls` help file to the screen

(*`e` is invalid, but needed for the demo)

[%step]
IMPORTANT: In some fonts, a `--` notation will appear as a single `-` when rendered.

== Permissions

The following is the output of `ls -lah` (long list,all files,human readable)
// [source,bash]

[quote, StackOverflow Blog, 5/23/2017]
How many people have been struggling to exit Vim?
In the last year, How to exit the Vim editor has made up about .005% of question traffic: that is, one out of every 20,000 visits to Stack Overflow questions. That means during peak traffic hours on weekdays, there are about 80 people per hour that need help getting out of Vim.

//image::images/exit_vim_over_time.png[]

<<<

endif::[]

`vim filename` - opens the designated file in normal mode

`:help` - displays the vim help file

`/texttosearch` - search for text in the document (case sensitive)

`i` - insert mode to edit the file

`esc` - return to command mode

`:w` - write/save the file to disk

`:q` - quit the editor if no changes were made or unsaved

`:wq` - write/save the file and quit the editor

`:q!` - quit the editor without saving the changes

== cp command

`cp filename /path/to/copy/to`

`cp filename newfilename`

copies the file from the current location/name to the new location/name

`cp -R /path/to/directory /path/to/new/directory`

copies the the files and directories from the specified directrory to the new location

== mv command

`mv filename /path/to/new/location`

`mv filename newfilename`

moves the file from the current location/name to the new location/name.

[NOTE]
`mv` also acts as the rename command.

== mkdir command

`mkdir directoryname`

`mkdir -p path/to/new/direcctory`

`mkdir -v`

`mkdir -m=744 directory`

creates directories to store files and directories 

== rm command

`rm filename`

removes (deletes) the indicated file

`rm -rf directoryname`

removes (deletes) the indicated directory and all of its contents, including hidden files

[IMPORTANT]
This is destructive. It cannot be undone.

== find command

`find . -name 'filename.txt'`

Searches for the filename.txt file in the current directory and sub directories

Change `.` in the above command to a path to start at that path and search its sub directories

Other popular factors to search on include owner, time, type, size, file types
//, and many others

== grep command

`grep -iR pattern Documents/`

Searches files for the phrase `pattern` in a case insensitive(i) manner in and below\(R) the local `Documents` directory.

== head/tail commands

`head -n 15 filename.txt`

`head` displays the first lines of a file (10 by default, 15 in the above example)

`tail -n 15 filename.txt`

`tail` displays the last lines of a file (10 by default, 15 in the above example)

`tail -f filename.txt`

The above use of the `tail` command with the `-f` flag continually rereads and displays the end of the file.
This is useful when monitoring a log file in real time, for example.
Use <ctrl>-c to stop reading the file.

== service/systemctl commands

The `service` and `systemctl` commands control the status of services on the system.
The following examples are for controlling the Apache web server status.

`service httpd {start,stop,restart,status}`

`systemctl {start,stop,restart,status} httpd`

== less command

`less filename`

Displays the contents of a file in the terminal window.

Use the up and down arrows to navigate the file.

Use the `v` key to edit the file in the system's default editor.
When you quit the editor, you return to the `less` process.

Use a forward slash followed by text to search for to find particular types.

`/texttosearchfor`

== tar command

`tar zxvf filename.tar.gz`

Extracts the contents of the tar.gz file to the current directory

`tar zcvf newcompressedfile.tar.gz file1 file2 file3`

Creates a new compressed file containing all the files indicated in the command

`tar zcvf newcompressedfile.tar.gz /path/to/files`

Creates a new compressed file containing all the files in the indicated directory

== sudo command

`sudo ls /var/log/messages`

By default, runs a command as the `root` user.
Adding `-u <user>` will specify a different user to run the command as.

== Pipe commands from one to another on a single line
// I'm not sure if join is the right word here

The pipe `|` symbol passes the output of a command to another command.

The following command will list the contents of the current directory in a long format.
The `grep` command then filters and displays only the lines of text that contain the word `filename` in a case insensitive manner.

`ls -l|grep -i filename`

[source,bash]
----
-rw-rw-r--. 1 chuck chuck          0 May 28 20:01 FILENAME.ADOC
-rw-rw-r--. 1 chuck chuck          0 May 28 20:00 filename.csv

-rw-rw-r--. 1 chuck chuck          0 May 28 20:00 filename.txt
----

The following command will run the  `ps -ef` command and show the results that match the phrase `ssh` on the screen

`ps -ef|grep ssh`

== man command

`man <command>`

The man command displays the manual (help) page for the command indicated.

Perhaps the most useful and under-utilized command in this presentation.

== ssh command

`ssh someuser@example.com`

`ssh someuser@webdevbox`

`ssh someuser@192.168.1.1`

`ssh myotherbox`

The above commands open a connection from the current computer to a remote computer.
You will be prompted for a password or utilize a matching ssh key for authentication.
Once connected, all commands you execute are performed on the remote machine.
If a username is specified, you are connected as that user.
If no username is specified, your current username is assumed.

`ssh someuser@example.com systemctl restart httpd`

The above command will log into the remote machine as someuser and run the command specified.
In this case, it is restarting the Apache webserver.


== Other interesting commands and concepts to follow up on

These are commands and concepts that are useful to know but may fall into niche categories.
Many of these will likely be useful at some point to this audience.

* `vimdiff` - for showing the differences between two text files
* `netstat`/`ss` - for showing open ports
* `firewall-cmd` - for configuring firewall rules
* `nmtui` - for configuring network manager from the command line
* `git` - version control for files
* `sed` - Stream line editor to change file contents without opening a full editor
* `md5sum` `sha1sum` (and others) creates a unique hash of a file to easily compare two or more files
* `scp` securely copies files between computers
* `!!` adds the last command to the current command line
* `screen` or `tmux` are terminal multiplexers, with `tmux` being the more modern version
* selinux - kernel security model that has been known to interfere with programs running correctly
* environmental variables - easily share configuration settings between applications and processes such as `$USER`, `$HOME`, `$EDITOR`, `$BROWSER`
* regex - Regular Expressions are your friend (once you make friends with them)

== Dangerous commands

These commands should not be used unless you really understand what you're doing with them.

`rm -rf /` - Will delete the entire file system

`mv file /dev/null` - will move the file to a system device that will delete the file

`:(){:|:&};:` - a fork bomb which creates a function and executes it until the system freezes

`$COMMAND > /dev/sda` - overwrites data on the block device, in this case the main drive

`mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda` - formats the block device using the ext4 filesystem, in this case the main drive.
mkfs.* may be a variety of filesystem types.

[NOTE]

This list is far from comprehensive.
It is provided to show that simple and innocent looking things can be very harmful.
Pay attention and understand the commands you copy and paste from the internet.
For more, search for `dangerous linux commands` in your favorite search engine

== Bash system files
// list and describe various bash config files
Bash is probably the most commonly used shell on *nix systems.
Similar files will exist for other shells.

`.bashrc` - configuration file for non-login shells

`.bash_profile` - configuration for login shells

`.bash_history` - history of the recent commands run in the bash shell

== Troubleshooting

log files are your friend

Common Location -- /var/log

Read recent system messages -- `tail /var/log/messages`

Print Kernel messages -- `dmesg`
